{"title": "Microsoft ships expanded Microsoft Teams for consumers", "image_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/03/ms-14-100836946-large.jpg", "contents": "Office 365 is dead. Long live Microsoft 365, the renamed version of Microsoft\u2019s productivity suite that now includes an expanded version of Microsoft Teams designed expressly for consumers. That expanded version of Teams is now live in preview for iOS and Android, Microsoft said on June 22.On April 21, Office 365 subscriptions for consumers will shift over to become Microsoft 365 subscriptions, Microsoft said, available at the current price of $9.99 per month or $99.99 per year for a shared group of up to 6 people. (Personal subscriptions are $6.99 per user per month, or $69.99 per year.) Those subscriptions will still include features like a terabyte of OneDrive cloud storage, access to Microsoft\u2019s Office apps, and more.What\u2019s new, though, is a version\u2014some might call it an expansion\u2014of Microsoft Teams that\u2019s been retooled for consumers, with group chat, file sharing, and more\u2014all features available on the enterprise version of Teams, but overhauled in a friendlier interface. Late in March, Microsoft also announced a new Microsoft Family Safety app designed to help parents keep track of their kids in the real world. Finally, Microsoft showed off new features within Office\u2014some of which had already been announced\u2014that tap into AI to improve its capabilities for writing within Word, scheduling within Excel, and more.Microsoft\u2019s Microsoft Teams has become a dominant corporate collaborative app because of Microsoft\u2019s relationship with large enterprises, but it faces a sharper challenge competing with dozens of consumer messaging apps that allow friends to connect with one another. Interestingly, while Microsoft is rebranding Office, the only rebranding of the new consumer Teams experience was in the , which was dubbed Teams for Home.\u00a0Officially, though, it\u2019s just Teams. And did we mention that this new Teams app is just for Android and iOS at the moment?As with the enterprise version of Teams, Microsoft has collected several collaborative features under the overarching Teams umbrella. The centralized feature is a group chat, which can be shared among multiple people\u2014Microsoft doesn\u2019t actually say how many, or whether all users have to subscribe to Teams. Alternatively, there\u2019s a \u201cdashboard\u201d view that can be used as a jumping-off point to have more detailed conversations, such as a direct phone call.Users can share their personal calendars or grocery lists, assign tasks to one another, and more. You could even track the locations of other members of their group, with their permission. Files can be stored even more securely via a \u201cvault.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s also promising that you\u2019ll be able to switch easily between work and personal accounts. That\u2019s noteworthy, possibly, because the current incarnation of Cortana that Microsoft is showing off within its  hasn\u2019t done the same.\u00a0Teams will launch in preview this summer for phones, Microsoft said, with an official launch scheduled for later this fall.Perhaps in recognition that Microsoft\u2019s Skype may have stumbled and let Zoom take over as the default consumer video app, Microsoft highlighted Skype Meet Now, a way to set a video meeting in Skype in just three clicks, without the need to download anything or even sign up for the service,Microsoft\u2019s new Family Safety app repurposes some of the family-management tools that Microsoft already has in place, including the ability for a parent to monitor your kids\u2019 screen time, and track where they go on the web. They\u2019re buried within the  website, however. Family Safety thrusts them front and center in an upcoming app.\u00a0 There are some new features, too, shared with the consumer revamp of Teams.Like the Your Family heading under the Microsoft account page, users will be able to monitor screen time for their kids across the Xbox and Windows, set limits, and control which sites, apps, and games kids will be able to access. Content filters can be set by age, if a website or game has enabled them.Although Microsoft acknowledges that\u00a0 leaving the house right now is \u201cthe new normal,\u201d the Family Safety app also was built for the assumption that we\u2019ll one day return to work and school. Assuming the child opts in to sharing location information\u2014left up to the child\u2014parents can receive a notification when the child has left school.This \u201cgeofencing\u201d capability will even be applied to student drivers. Both the parent and the driver will have access to detailed insights that will help them understand driving behavior and improve some of their habits on the road: their top speed, where they\u2019ve gone, and even the times that they\u2019ve picked up their phone or rapidly accelerated, executives said.\u00a0Otherwise, Microsoft highlighted new and existing capabilities that will appear in Office apps over the next few months, including improved connection to personal accounts within Outlook, and the revival of sorts of Microsoft Money.A small but extremely timely feature will be tighter integration between home and business accounts within Outlook and Calendar. What was especially interesting was a feature Microsoft showed off where consumers could search for schools by area code, than drill down by name\u2014and after that, integrate the school\u2019s public calendar with the users\u2019 own. That\u2019s especially useful at times like now, when students don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ll be asked to remain home, and when they\u2019ll return. It also will allow work colleagues to see when others have blocked out time for personal appointments.Microsoft didn\u2019t say when the new Outlook features will arrive. In the coming months, however, Microsoft will launch \u201cMoney in Excel,\u201d a new feature that uses Excel\u2019s expertise in integrating data sources to pull your spending into a single spreadsheet.\u00a0It\u2019s a change from Microsoft\u2019s stance in 2009, when the company  because of the competition banks themselves offered. \u201cWith banks, brokerage firms and Web sites now providing a range of options for managing personal finances, the consumer need for Microsoft Money Plus has changed,\u201d the company said at the time.Now, Microsoft\u2019s making a play for Excel to serve as a focal point for you to manage your money, including connecting to your bank and credit card accounts. Money will import transactions and account balances automatically, offer insights on how much you\u2019re spending on categories like groceries each month, and even issue proactive alerts about price changes for recurring payments, bank fees, overdraft warnings, and more, Microsoft said.Otherwise, Microsoft highlighted and expanded on a few features that it\u2019s already added to Office. One of those is Presenter Coach, a feature already within PowerPoint that provides feedback on how many times you\u2019ve said \u201cfiller\u201d words like \u201cah\u201d or \u201cum.\u201d Presenter Coach will now listen to your tone of voice and let you know if you\u2019re speaking in a monotone, and a separate \u201cspeech refinement\u201d feature will offer suggestions on how better to phrase your speech.\u00a0These new Presenter Coach features will be available to everyone through a free preview, and then eventually only to\u00a0\u00a0subscribers, Microsoft said.Microsoft\u2019s also making AI tools available to writers. Microsoft will publish a new Microsoft Editor extension for Edge and Chrome in the coming weeks, Microsoft said, which will provide suggestions on style, clarity, inclusive language, and more for browser-based writing on Medium, Facebook and more.Microsoft\u2019s also retooling what\u2019s currently called \u201cIdeas in Word\u201d and renaming it \u201cEditor in Word.\u201d The Editor section includes two big additions: a \u201csimilarity checker\u201d that intelligently scans your document for similarities to published sources, and then allows users to publish citations. A \u201crewrite suggestions\u201d option will also be available; this AI editor suggests ways to retool your writing to make it clearer. Both of these options, however, will only be available to Word for the Web.Microsoft\u2019s applying similar tools to Outlook.com and Outlook on the Web, but there\u2019s a catch:\u00a0Editor\u2019s spelling and grammar capabilities will be offered for free to Outlook.com users, while more advanced style-oriented capabilities will\u00a0be extended\u00a0exclusively\u00a0to Microsoft 365 subscribers.Over time, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see more of this trend: a \u201ctaste\u201d of Microsoft\u2019s new AI capabilities will be offered to users, with more value-added features offered to Microsoft 365 users. That, of course, is the overarching goal: to sign you up for a recurring Microsoft subscription.This story, \"Microsoft ships expanded Microsoft Teams for consumers\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."},

All that said, there are specific chips that stand out from the horde as the best gaming CPUs due to their price, performance, or nifty extras.Whether you\u2019re on a budget or willing to pay for sheer face-melting , these are the best CPUs for gaming PCs that you can buy.AMD revealed slightly faster versions of its popular Ryzen 3000 processors on June 16, adopting the \u201cXT\u201d moniker introduced by the Ryzen RX 5000-series graphics cards. The $249 Ryzen 5 3600XT, $399 Ryzen 7 3800XT, and $500 Ryzen 9 3900XT will launch on July 7 with moderate clock speed boosts and no cooler for the two top-end chips. .($205 on )Intel\u2019s ruled the gaming roost for seemingly time eternal, but in 2019, AMD seized the mainstream crown. Overall, the $200 to $235 Ryzen 5 3600X is the best gaming CPU for most people, though  compete much more fiercely than 9th-gen chips did. The $275 Core i5-10600K is a bit faster than the AMD chip at gaming, but costs significantly more overall. You can\u2019t go wrong with either chip. Meanwhile, the $175 Ryzen 5 3600 provides outstanding value.AMD bestows its Ryzen parts with simultaneous multi-threading, giving the six-core Ryzen 5 3600X a full twelve threads. That gives some serious productivity chops for a mainstream CPU. But for the first time in recent memory, AMD\u2019s mainstream chip hangs tough with its Intel counterparts, too. AMD infused its third-gen Ryzen chips with massive instructions-per-clock (IPC) improvements and faster clock speeds, with the 3.8GHz Ryzen 5 3600X capable of boosting up to 4.4GHz.Together, those gains help propel the 3600X past Intel\u2019s Core i5-9600K in  testing, and the beloved Core i7-8086K in  testing. Most AMD motherboards support overclocking for the adventurous if you want to try your hands at even better performance.You can find the Ryzen 5 3600X for , and often for as little as $200 online, down from a $250 launch price. Better yet, AMD tosses in three free months of Microsoft\u2019s superb Xbox Game Pass for PC with every Ryzen purchase. That\u2019s a lot of free gaming goodness to go with a great gaming processor.The newer 6-core, 12-thread, \u00a0puts up a tougher fight against AMD\u2019s chip than its predecessor, thanks to its high clock speeds and the reintroduction of Hyper-Threading. Intel\u2019s chip is actually faster than AMD\u2019s at 1080p gaming overall in reviews at , , , and , though the Ryzen 5 3600 wins a handful of comparisons, and the performance gaps shrinks substantially as you go up in resolution. Intel\u2019s chip especially rocks in esports titles. If you won\u2019t accept anything but the  mainstream gaming performance, the Core i5-10600K is your chip. It\u2019s on a par with last gen\u2019s Core i9-9900K flagship, and Intel\u2019s best 10th-gen offering.That said, the Ryzen 5 3600X hangs with Intel\u2019s Core i5 for  gaming purposes\u2014reviewers say the performance difference is close enough that you won\u2019t see much change with your naked eye, outside of competitive gaming scenarios. We give the edge to AMD due to its lower overall cost: The Ryzen 5 3600X costs $40 to $75 less on the street, and it comes bundled with a Wraith CPU cooler. You\u2019ll need to spring for your own cooler with the Core i5-10600K, and the Z490 motherboards you\u2019ll need to plop it into tend to cost more than established AMD AM4 motherboards. Plus, if you want to spend up for a newer 500-series AM4 motherboard, the Ryzen chip supports . Intel hasn\u2019t jumped onto that bandwagon yet.If you want to spend a little less cash, or don\u2019t mind overclocking, consider the AMD Ryzen 5 3600 instead. The non-X version costs . It packs the same six cores and twelve threads as the 3600X but runs a little slower, with a 3.6GHz base clock and 4.2GHz boost clock. The reduction in clock speeds drops the Ryzen 5 3600\u2019s gaming performance a bit. The chip trades blows with Intel\u2019s Core i5-9600K in gaming benchmarks at  and , but it\u2019s close. Both sites give the Ryzen 5 3600 a hearty recommendation. It\u2019s an outstanding value, though we think it\u2019s worthwhile to spend the extra $20 for the 3600X\u2019s higher clock speeds if you can swing it.\u00a0($120 at ) or\u00a0($100 on )If you want a gaming CPU that won\u2019t break the bank, look no further than the \u00a0if you want modest game-ready graphics included with your chip, or the \u00a0if you plan to BYO graphics card.The four-core, eight-thread Ryzen 3 3300X achieves performance equal to or better than Intel\u2019s former Core i7-7700K flagship at a fraction of the cost, delivering \u201cunprecedented value\u201d per . Gamers Nexus is just as glowing in , stating that \u201can R3 is enough for gaming.\u201d It\u2019s only a few paces behind the Ryzen 5 3600 in most games, so if you don\u2019t need the more expensive chip\u2019s extra cores for productivity tasks, this is a great value for the money.There\u2019s never been a low-budget gaming chip with performance this competitive. Better yet, AMD tosses a cooler into the box, the chip can be overclocked, and compatible B450 motherboards are both cheap and plentiful. Alternatively, if you want to future-proof your system with a pricier 500-series AM4 motherboard, the chip can support PCIe 4.0 storage, though you\u2019ll probably want to wait for B550 motherboards to roll out in mid-June if you\u2019re going that route.The step-down , but it\u2019s less compelling. Due to a technical difference in how its CPU cores communicate, it tends to lag behind the Ryzen 3 3300X in both productivity and gaming. Save up the extra $20.Another option would be to invest $100 in our other budget gaming pick, which can let you game even if you can\u2019t spend extra on graphics. The continuation of AMD\u2019s \u201cAPU\u201d strategy,\u00a0the \u00a0blends four Ryzen CPU cores with eight of AMD\u2019s powerful Radeon Vega compute units. The end result? A solid-performing chip that can play PC games without the need for a graphics card.It\u2019s built using 12nm Zen+ cores rather than the 7nm Zen 2 cores in other third-gen Ryzen processors, but the Ryzen 3 3200G should still deliver enough punch for basic gaming. Its predecessor,\u00a0, handled e-sports titles like\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0with ease and turned in surprisingly good frame rates even in AAA games like\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0. You might need to alter some graphics settings and maybe dial the game resolution back to 720p for the best results, but you can get the vast majority of games running between 30 and 60 frames per second with some tinkering.The Ryzen 3 3200G should perform slightly better thanks to faster clock speeds. Its CPU cores are about 300MHz faster than the 2200G\u2019s, while the integrated Radeon Vega GPU cores are about 150MHz faster. That said, the Ryzen 3 3200G\u2019s older manufacturing process and lack of multi-threading make the Ryzen 3 3300X a better pick if you\u2019re planning on jamming a graphics card into your system as well. It\u2019s just plain faster as a processor.If you\u2019re buying a Ryzen APU, though, make sure your chosen motherboard includes an HDMI port. Without a graphics card inside your system, you\u2019ll be reliant on it for video output. ($525 on )If you absolutely, positively need the fastest frame rates possible, price be damned, you\u2019ll want Intel\u2019s $525 Core i9-10900K. Well,\u00a0\u00a0$525. The high-end, ten-core chip just launched, and paired with Intel\u2019s ongoing supply constraints, it\u2019s hard to find on the street right now.If you can find one, this 10-core, 20-thread processor comes clocked at 3.7GHz base and can fly all the way up to 5.3GHz under the right conditions.\u00a0It came out ahead of the Ryzen 9 3900X across all but  gaming test we threw at it. The wins usually come in the form of a single-digit percentage performance lead, but it earns more substantial victories in  and ., full stop\u2014and thanks to the increased core count, it can now hang near AMD\u2019s high-end Ryzen chips in productivity tasks, too.It might not be the most practical option for most people, though\u2014even gaming enthusiasts with deep pockets. The blazing-fast clock speeds start to matter less when you pair the 9900KS with a high-end graphics card at 1440p or 4K resolutions, which shifts the performance bottleneck over to the GPU in most games. You\u2019ll get the most out of Intel\u2019s ludicrously fast flagship at 1080p resolution. Because of that, and some other considerations, AMD and Intel both offer some very intriguing alternatives.It might not be the most practical option for most people, though\u2014even gaming enthusiasts with deep pockets.

You\u2019ll get the most out of Intel\u2019s ludicrously fast flagship at 1080p resolution. The chip also chugs down a of power and lacks support for cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 storage. Because of that, and the sky-high cost of the 10900K, AMD and Intel both offer some very intriguing alternatives.Let\u2019s start with Intel\u2019s options. If you\u2019re on the hunt simply for an optimal gaming experience and don\u2019t need a legion of cores and threads for productivity, the 8-core, 16-thread  might be worth considering. It\u2019s just as fast as the pricier Core i9-10900K in gaming loads, per  and , but costs significantly less. But the Core i5-10600K discussed previously is  as fast for over\u00a0 $100 less, however, and Intel\u2019s Core i7 chip gets fiercely outmatched by comparable AMD processors in productivity tasks, especially when it comes to performance per dollar.Gaming isn\u2019t all most people do on their computers, of course. If you do a lot of work on your PC, especially resource-intensive tasks like streaming or media editing, one of AMD\u2019s third-gen Ryzen chips is probably a better option. AMD\u2019s been making aggressive price moves around Intel\u2019s 10th-gen launch to be more competitive. Ryzen 3000-series chips also hold an edge in power efficiency and PCIe 4.0 support.\u201cIn the end, AMD still makes it a better choice and a better deal for most, but for those who want higher clock speeds and more performance on lighter workloads, Intel\u2019s 10th gen Core i9-10900K and its sibling at least are worth considering,\u201d we said in our 10900K review. \u201cThat, frankly, is a victory from the situation it has been in.\u201dThe $750 Ryzen 9 3950X is , sporting a whopping 16 cores, 32 threads, and the highest clock speeds of any Ryzen chip. Even the \u00a0comes loaded with 12 cores and 24 threads, outstripping Intel\u2019s options despite costing over $100 less than the Core i9-10900K after a steep price cut.Better yet, AMD infused its third-gen Ryzen chips with significant IPC and clock speed improvements, putting the 3950X and  just barely behind Intel\u2019s fearsome 9900K in 1080p gaming benchmarks. The divide shrinks even further if you play at 1440p or 4K resolution, as those shift more of the bottleneck onto your system\u2019s graphics card. Third-gen Ryzen chips burn rubber in gaming, especially at higher resolutions that systems with high-end parts like these usually run. The Ryzen 9 pairing absolutely pounds Intel\u2019s lineup in multi-threaded tasks."},

The attacker then demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon payment.\u00a0Users are shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key. The costs can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, payable to cybercriminals in Bitcoin.There are a number of vectors ransomware can take to access a computer. One of the most common delivery systems is  spam \u2014 attachments that come to the victim in an email, masquerading as a file they should trust. Once they're downloaded and opened, they can take over the victim's computer, especially if they have built-in  tools that trick users into allowing administrative access. Some other, more aggressive forms of ransomware, like , exploit security holes to infect computers without needing to trick users.There are several things the malware might do once it\u2019s taken over the victim's computer, but by far the most common action is to encrypt some or all of the user's files. If you want the technical details, the Infosec Institute has . But the most important thing to know is that at the end of the process, the files cannot be decrypted without a mathematical key known only by the attacker. The user is presented with a message explaining that their files are now are now inaccessible and will only be decrypted if the victim sends an untraceable Bitcoin payment to the attacker.In some forms of malware, the attacker might  shutting down the victim's computer due to the presence of pornography or pirated software on it, and demanding the payment of a \"fine,\" perhaps to make victims less likely to report the attack to authorities. But most attacks don't bother with this pretense. There is also a variation,  in which the attacker threatens to publicize sensitive data on the victim's hard drive unless a ransom is paid. But because finding and extracting such information is a very tricky proposition for attackers, encryption ransomware is by far the most common type.There are several different ways attackers . Sometimes it's a matter of opportunity: for instance, attackers might target universities because they tend to have smaller security teams and a disparate user base that does a lot of file sharing, making it easier to penetrate their defenses.On the other hand, some organizations are tempting targets because they seem more likely to pay a ransom quickly. For instance, government agencies or medical facilities often need immediate access to their files. Law firms and other organizations with sensitive data may be willing to pay to keep news of a compromise quiet \u2014 and these organizations may be uniquely sensitive to leakware attacks.But don't feel like you're safe if you don't fit these categories: as we noted, some ransomware spreads automatically and indiscriminately across the internet.There are a number of defensive steps you can take to . These steps are a of course good security practices in general, so following them improves your defenses from all sorts of attacks:If your computer has been infected with ransomware, you'll need to regain control of your machine. CSO's Steve Ragan has a great video demonstrating how to do this on a Windows 10 machine:The video has all the details, but the important steps are to:But here's the important thing to keep in mind: while walking through these steps can remove the malware from your computer and restore it to your control, it  Their transformation into unreadability has already happened, and if the malware is at all sophisticated, it will be mathematically impossible for anyone to decrypt them without access to the key that the attacker holds. In fact, by removing the malware, you've precluded the possibility of restoring your files by paying the attackers the ransom they've asked for.There's a lot of money in ransomware, and the market expanded rapidly from the beginning of the decade. In 2017, ransomware resulted in , both in terms of ransoms paid and spending and lost time in recovering from attacks. That's up 15 times from 2015. In the first quarter of 2018, just one kind of ransomware software, SamSam, .Many high-profile ransomware attacks have occurred in hospitals or other medical organizations, which make tempting targets: attackers know that, with lives literally in the balance, these enterprises are more likely to simply pay a relatively low ransom to make a problem go away. It's estimated that , and, conversely, that . Another tempting industry? The financial services sector, which is, as Willie Sutton famously remarked, where the money is. It's estimated that . \u00a0\u00a0Ransomware is constantly being written and tweaked by its developers, and so its signatures are often not caught by typical anti-virus programs. In fact, as many as 75 percent of companies that fall victim to ransomware were .If you want a bit of good news, it's this: the number of ransomware attacks, after exploding in the mid '10s, has gone into a decline, though the initial numbers were high enough that it's still. But in the first quarter of 2017, ransomware attacks \u00a0percent. \u00a0What's behind this big dip? In many ways it's an economic decision based on the cybercriminal's currency of choice: bitcoin. Extracting a ransom from a victim has always been hit or miss; they might not decide to pay, or even if they want to, they might not be familiar enough with bitcoin to figure out how to actually do so.As , the decline in ransomware has been matched by a rise in so-called  malware, which infects the victim computer and uses its computing power to create (or  in cryptocurrency parlance) bitcoin without the owner knowing. This is a neat route to using someone else's resources to get bitcoin that bypasses most of the difficulties in scoring a ransom, and it has only gotten more attractive as a cyberattack as the price of bitcoin spiked in late 2017.That doesn't mean the threat is over, however. There are two different kinds of ransomware attackers: \"commodity\" attacks that try to infect computers indiscriminately by sheer volume and include so-called \"ransomware as a service\" platforms that criminals can rent; and targeted groups that focus on particularly vulnerable market segments and organizations. You should be on guard if you're in the latter category, no matter if the big ransomware boom has passed.With the price of bitcoin dropping over the course of 2018, the cost-benefit analysis for attackers might shift back. Ultimately, using ransomware or cryptomining malware is a business decision for attackers, says Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at McAfee. \u201cAs cryptocurrency prices drop, it\u2019s natural to see a shift back [to ransomware].\"If your system has been infected with malware, and you've lost vital data that you can't restore from backup, should you pay the ransom?\u00a0When speaking theoretically, most law enforcement agencies urge you not to pay ransomware attackers, on the logic that doing so only encourages hackers to create more ransomware. That said, many organizations that find themselves afflicted by malware quickly stop thinking in terms of the \"greater good\" and start doing , weighing the price of the ransom against the value of the encrypted data. According to research from Trend Micro, while 66 percent of companies  they would never pay a ransom as a point of principle, in practice 65 percent actually do pay the ransom when they get hit.Ransomware attackers keep prices relatively low \u2014 usually between $700 and $1,300, an amount companies can usually afford to pay on short notice. Some particularly sophisticated malware will detect the country where the infected computer is running and adjust the ransom to match that nation's economy, demanding more from companies in rich countries and less from those in poor regions.There are often discounts offered for acting fast, so as to encourage victims to pay quickly before thinking too much about it. In general, the price point is set so that it's high enough to be worth the criminal's while, but low enough that it's often cheaper than what the victim would have to pay to restore their computer or reconstruct the lost data. With that in mind, some companies are beginning to build the potential need to pay ransom into their security plans: for instance, some large UK companies who are otherwise uninvolved with cryptocurrency are  specifically for ransom payments.There are a couple of tricky things to remember here, keeping in mind that the people you're dealing with are, of course, criminals. First, what looks like ransomware may not have actually encrypted your data at all; make sure you aren't dealing with so-called \"\" before you send any money to anybody. And second, paying the attackers doesn't guarantee that you'll get your files back. Sometimes the criminals just take the money and run, and may not have even built decryption functionality into the malware. But any such malware will quickly get a reputation and won't generate revenue, so in most cases \u2014 Gary Sockrider, principal security technologist at Arbor Networks,  \u2014 the crooks come through and your data is restored.While ransomware has technically been around since the '90s, it's only taken off in the past five years or so, largely because of the availability of untraceable payment methods like Bitcoin. Some of the worst offenders have been:This list is just going to get longer.

If so, you probably turn to the most popular presentation application in the world, PowerPoint, one of the core apps that make up Microsoft\u2019s Office suite.Microsoft sells Office under two models: Individuals and businesses can pay for the software license up front and own it forever (what the company calls the \u201cperpetual\u201d version of the suite), or they can purchase an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 subscription, which means they have access to the software for only as long as they keep paying the subscription fee.When you purchase a perpetual version of the suite \u2014 say,  or  \u2014 its applications will never get new features, whereas apps in an Office 365/Microsoft 365 subscription are continually updated with new features. (For more details, see\u00a0\u201c\u201d)This cheat sheet gets you up to speed on the features that were introduced in PowerPoint 2016 and PowerPoint 2019, the perpetual-license versions of PowerPoint included with Office 2016 and Office 2019, respectively. In Office 365, PowerPoint has all those features, plus several more. We\u2019ll soon be publishing a separate PowerPoint for Office 365 cheat sheet that covers all its latest features.Most of the tips in this article apply to both PowerPoint 2016 and PowerPoint 2019 for Windows. Near the end are tips for PowerPoint 2019 only, and then we wrap up with handy keyboard shortcuts for both versions.The Ribbon interface in PowerPoint 2016 and 2019 hasn't changed much compared to earlier versions. Because the Ribbon has been included in Office suite applications since Office 2007, we assume you're familiar with how it works. If you need a refresher, see our .As in PowerPoint 2013, the Ribbon in PowerPoint 2016 and 2019 has a flattened look that's cleaner and less cluttered than in PowerPoint 2010 and 2007. The newer Ribbon is smaller than it was in PowerPoint 2013, the title bar is red rather than white, and the text for the Ribbon tabs (File, Home, Insert and so on) is a mix of upper- and lowercase rather than all caps. But it still works in the same way, and you'll find most of the commands in the same locations as in PowerPoint 2013.To find out which commands live on which tabs on the Ribbon, download our . Also see the nifty new Tell Me feature described below.\u00a0As in previous versions of PowerPoint, if you want the commands underneath the tabs on the Ribbon to go away, press Ctrl-F1. To make them reappear, press Ctrl-F1 again. (Note that the Ribbon tabs \u2014 File, Home, Insert and so on \u2014 stay visible.)You\u2019ve got other options for displaying the Ribbon as well. To get to them, click the Ribbon Display Options icon at the top right of the screen, just to the left of the icons for minimizing and maximizing PowerPoint. A drop-down menu appears with these three options:And if for some reason that nice red color on the title bar is just too much for you, you can turn it white or gray. (In PowerPoint 2019, there\u2019s also a black option.) To do it, select . In the \"Personalize your copy of Microsoft Office\" section, click the down arrow next to Office Theme, and select Dark Gray or White (or Black) from the drop-down menu. To make the title bar red again, instead choose the \"Colorful\" option from the drop-down list. Just above the Office Theme menu is an Office Background drop-down menu \u2014 here you can choose to display a pattern such as a circuit board or circles and stripes in the title bar.There\u2019s a very useful change in what Microsoft calls the backstage area that appears when you click File on the Ribbon: If you click Open, Save a Copy, Save or Save As from the menu on the left, you can see the cloud-based services you've connected to your Office account, such as SharePoint and OneDrive. Each location displays its associated email address underneath it. This is quite helpful if you use a cloud service with more than one account, such as if you have one OneDrive account for personal use and another one for business. You'll be able to see at a glance which is which.You can also easily add new cloud-based services. From the screen that shows you your online locations, click \u201cAdd a Place,\u201d and choose which service to add. Note, though, that you\u2019re limited to SharePoint and OneDrive.PowerPoint is so chock-full of powerful features that it can be tough to remember where to find them all. Microsoft has made it easier with a feature in PowerPoint 2016 and 2019 called Tell Me, which puts even buried tools or those you rarely use in easy reach.To use it, click the \"Tell me what you want to do\" text to the right of the Help tab on the Ribbon. (Those who prefer keyboard shortcuts can instead press Alt-Q.) Then type in a task you want to do, such as \"change handout orientation.\" You'll get a menu showing potential matches for the task.In this instance, the top result is a Handout Orientation listing that when clicked gives you two options \u2014 one to set the orientation to horizontal and the other to vertical. Just click the one you want to use. If you'd like more information about your task, the last two items that appear in the Tell Me menu let you select from related Help topics or search for your phrase using Smart Lookup. (More on Smart Lookup below.)Even if you consider yourself a PowerPoint pro, give Tell Me a try. It'll save you lots of time and is much more efficient than hunting through the Ribbon to find a command. It also remembers the features you've previously clicked on in the box, so when you click in it, you first see a list of previous tasks you've searched for. That makes sure that tasks that you frequently perform are always within easy reach, while at the same time making tasks you rarely do easily accessible.If you do research to gather information for presentations, you\u2019ll want to check out another feature, Smart Lookup. It lets you do online research from right within PowerPoint while you're working on a presentation, so there\u2019s no need to fire up your browser, search the web, and then copy the information to your presentation.To use Smart Lookup, right-click a word or group of words and select Smart Lookup from the menu that appears. PowerPoint then uses Bing to do a web search on the word or phrase and displays definitions, any related Wikipedia entries, and other results from the web in the Smart Lookup pane that appears on the right. If you just want a definition of the word, click the Define tab in the pane.Smart Lookup has been getting smarter over time. When the feature first launched, it wasn\u2019t very good at finding specific, timely information such as the current inflation rate in the United States. It was much better at finding more general information, such as a biography of the artificial intelligence pioneer Arthur Samuel. But Microsoft has done a lot of work on it, and it now works well when finding granular information as well.Keep in mind that in order to use Smart Lookup in PowerPoint or any other Office app, you might first need to enable Microsoft's intelligent services feature, which collects your search terms and some content from your presentations and other documents. (If you're concerned about privacy, you'll need to decide whether the privacy hit is worth the convenience of doing research from right within the app.) If you haven't enabled it, you'll see a screen when you click Smart Lookup asking you to turn it on. Once you do so, it will be turned on across all your Office applications.The most important feature that launched with PowerPoint 2016 for those who work with others is live collaboration that lets people work on presentations together from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. To do it, you must be logged into your Microsoft or Office 365 account, and the presentation must be stored in OneDrive, OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online.However, while Office 365 subscribers or anyone using PowerPoint Online can see the changes that other users of those versions make to a shared presentation in real time as they happen, PowerPoint 2016 and 2019 users have to save their presentations periodically to see and share changes. So while it is live collaboration, it\u2019s not real-time  into that collaboration. Still, it does allow you to work with others on the same presentation at the same time.To collaborate on a presentation, open it, then click the Share icon in the upper-right part of the screen. If you haven\u2019t yet saved your file in OneDrive, OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online, you\u2019ll be prompted to do so.Clicking the Share button opens the Share pane on the right-hand side of the screen. Think of the pane as command central for collaboration. At the top of the pane, type in the email addresses of the people with whom you want to collaborate on the presentation, separated by commas. As you type, PowerPoint looks through your address book and displays the matches it finds; click the person you want to invite. If you\u2019re on a corporate network, you can click the address book on the right to search through your corporate email address book. If a person isn\u2019t in your address book, type in the complete email address.After you enter the addresses, select either \"Can edit\" or \"Can view\" in the drop-down to allow collaborators full editing or read-only privileges. (If you want to assign different rights to different users, send separate emails, or you can change any collaborator\u2019s permissions later by right-clicking their name in the Share pane.) Type a message in the text box if you want. When you\u2019re done, click Share. An email is sent out to everyone with whom you\u2019ve shared the file, showing a button that they can click to open the presentation.There\u2019s another way to share a file stored in a personal OneDrive for collaboration: At the bottom of the Share pane, click \u201cGet a sharing link,\u201d and from the screen that appears, choose \u201cCreate an edit link\u201d if you want to create a link to the file that will allow people to edit the file, or \u201cCreate a view-only link\u201d if you want to create a link that will allow them to view the file only. Then create an email using any email program, copy the link and send it.When your recipients get the email invitation from you, they click a button or link to open the presentation, which opens in PowerPoint Online in a web browser rather than in the PowerPoint desktop client. At this point, they can view the presentation but not edit it. Users who aren\u2019t signed into a Microsoft account will see an Edit in Browser button; once they click that, they can start editing in their browser window. Logged in users will see an Edit Presentation menu, from which they can choose Edit in PowerPoint to open the file in the client version of PowerPoint, or Edit in Browser to work in the free web version.The web version isn\u2019t as fully featured as the client version \u2014 for instance, there aren\u2019t as many transitions and animations, you can\u2019t record your screen from inside PowerPoint, and you can\u2019t give slideshows or use several other features. But for basic editing, it works fine.When one or more collaborators are working in a shared presentation, the Share button will change to reflect the number of people working on it (including you). As mentioned above, you\u2019ll have to save your presentation periodically to see their changes or have them see yours. After you save, your collaborators\u2019 additions appear in your presentation.Be aware that how well real-time collaboration works depends on the strength of your internet connection. On slow or flaky connections, you won\u2019t immediately see edits that other people make and they won\u2019t see yours immediately \u2014 there will be a lag. So it\u2019s always best, when possible, to have the strongest connection possible when collaborating.In addition to seeing each other\u2019s changes to the presentation, you can communicate with your collaborators in other ways. The Share pane shows a list of people who have access to the presentation, with a note underneath their name indicating if they are currently editing the presentation, and if not, whether they have editing or viewing access.Click or hover your cursor over the icon of anyone working on the presentation, and a screen pops out with the various ways you can contact that person, including text chat, phone and video via Skype (if the person has Skype) and email. That lets you talk or text while you're working on the presentation together, making collaboration that much more effective."}
